        <h4>My Work History</h4>
        <p>With a passion for organization and technical precision, I dedicated four years as a Stage Manager in high school, overseeing the entire technical side of every production. From managing lighting and sound to coordinating backstage crews, I ensured each show ran smoothly and professionally. This experience honed my leadership, problem-solving, and multitasking skills, preparing me for high-pressure environments that require both creativity and technical expertise.</p>
        <p>Building on that foundation, I stepped into the role of Senior Technician at Activate Games in May 2024, where I continue to contribute to the innovation and maintenance of high-tech, interactive gaming experiences. My role involves troubleshooting complex systems, optimizing game functionality, and ensuring seamless player experiences. This hands-on position has strengthened my technical acumen while allowing me to work in a fast-paced, cutting-edge environment that blends technology and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Academically, I am pursuing a Web Development associate degree at Dallas College, equipping myself with the skills to build dynamic, user-friendly websites. Additionally, I earned the prestigious Harvard CS50 Computer Science certification, which deepened my knowledge of programming fundamentals, algorithms, and software development. With a strong foundation in both practical and theoretical tech fields, I am driven to expand my expertise and apply my skills to impactful digital projects</p>
